# Future Scope

I believe my work on the Noted-App opens up new avenues for not just the Discussion Forum but also for the rest of Winter Of Code. It allows the possiblity of making a lot of existing features use the benefit of real time and to make new features which take benefit of it. I would look forward to seeing the following in Submitty in future.

* User can customize the wallpaper of the app.

* User can request to the admin for upload his/her notes.

* Push Notifications to users

* There is lot of room for improvements in widgets.







# Overall Experience


I would like to express my gratitude to my mentor's Rajwrita &  Ayush Singh (thanks for going through all my PRs!) for his patient guidance and valuable insights. I would also like to thank for his/her effective organization and essential perspectives and contexts he/she provides.

Furthermore, my thanks are extended to NSEC students and other Winter Of Code  students I am working with during the Winter. It has been a great experience working at Winter of Code.

Winter Of Code with DSC NSEC was a warm and unforgettable experience for me. Everytime I talk of Open Source, DSC NSEC will be remembered fondly.
