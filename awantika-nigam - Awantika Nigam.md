### DSC-X : IWasAt.Events

DSC-X is a one of the university base community groups for the students interested in Google developer technologies. Students grow their knowledge through peer- to - peer learning environments and build solutions for real-time problems.

[IWasAt](https://sairish2001.github.io/omgframestesting.github.io/) is one of the projects of DSC-X which aims at providing badges for all the events that happen across the Student Clubs. Students can upload their photograph and get their amazing event badges in different shapes and sizes.Participants can add these badges across various social media platforms in order to showcase their participation. 

I am [Awantika Nigam](https://github.com/awantika10), an undergraduate student in Electronics and Communication from [Lakshmi Narain College of Technology,Bhopal](https://lnct.ac.in/), as a part of [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/). This project was mentored by [Anubhav Singh](https://github.com/xprilion)

The project was focused on making badges for the students all over more user friendly and  progressive . I worked equally on number of other features which involved creating wireframes, designs, mockups and Front-End of the website. 
To sum things up, this was a great full-stack project and I enjoyed working on designing part of DSC-X!
