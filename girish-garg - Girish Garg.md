### Tesseract Coding : NeoAlgo

# C++ Algorithms Upgrade

The project was an upgrade to the C++ Algorithms section of NeoAlgo. The project aims to have all possible algorithms and data structures implemented in C++ at one place

I am [Girish Garg](https://github.com/gargVader), an undergraduate student from [IEM](https://iem.edu.in/), [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), as part of [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/).

#### 1. New Algorithms added

I added various new algorithms. I created three new sections: Stack based problems, Heap based problems and Computational Geometry.

## Future Scope of Work

I believe my work on the NeoAlgo opens up new avenues for not just the C++ sections but also for the rest of languages. There are still many algorithms that can be added.

## Acknowledgments

I had an enriching and exciting winter of 2020, working on NeoAlgo under the [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/) program. I express my sincere thanks to all people who worked on NeoAlgo.

WoC with NeoAlgo was a warm and unforgettable experience for me. Everytime I talk of Open Source, Tesseract Coding will be remembered fondly.
