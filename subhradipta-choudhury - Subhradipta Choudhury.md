# New Features
- Tasks based on string operations done within O(n) time complexity.
- Sorting of an array of combinations of three numbers are done within O(n) time complexity instead of O(n.log(n)) complexity.
- The middle node of a linked list found in a single traversal.

# Small Bugs
- Binary addition of two strings can be done in a better way.
- Some codes yielding wrong output previously. Later, it's solved.
- Reduced time complexities in necessary portions.

# Future Scope

As this project is for them who want to step in the field of Competitive Programming, that's based on Data Structures & Algorithms. Therefore, according to me, problems can be arranged in such a way that a particular problem may done using different techniques. For example, the task Beanpole Cut under Dynamic Programming can be given under the recursion category too. So that, the newbie can get a clear idea of what is happening for the same task using different ways. And doing so, they can compare them and find the optimized one.

# Overall Experience
The whole month was productive indeed. Learned various new approaches and algorithms. Learned how to contribute in open-source projects and how to utilize the features of git and github. Also, learned different tips and tricks of competitive programming. Our mentors are very kind, knowledgeable, humble and helpful. I got stuck badly in the beginning of program with some commits and branching issues (previously I had zero idea about these things). Mentors helped a lot in making a way out through it. Apart from that, they helped in many ways and mentored us very well.  So, my overall experience in Winter of Code 2020 was amazing.
