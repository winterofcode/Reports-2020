### [Dynopii](https://dynopii.com/) : [pyvirtualaudiocable](https://github.com/dynopii/pyvirtualaudiocable)

## *Overview*

#### About me

- Hello, I'm [Tushar Nankani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tusharnankani/), second year Computer Engineering student from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College (TSEC), Mumbai and this Winter I worked under the [dynopii](https://dynopii.com/) organization as a WoC student.

#### About the Project - *PyVirtualAudioCable*

- In the simplest terms, just as there are printer drivers that do not connect to a printer at all but rather write to a PDF file.
- Analogously, there are virtual audio drivers available that do not connect to a physical microphone at all but can pipe input from other sources such as files or other programs.

Our primary goal was to build a pipeline, and the project had to be built from scratch. I was in-charge of building a virtual pipeline on the Windows Operating System.

#### Research Work

- My complete research work is documented over here - [tusharnankani/dynopii-research-work](https://github.com/tusharnankani/dynopii-research-work). Since, the project did not have an existing codebase, the complete project had to built from scratch.

Hence, most of the time was invested in the intensive research. I wasn't successful in making any PRs but it taught me that development isn't only just code. It is much more.

# Future Scope

- This project can be built to a great extent, building a python script for the Windows OS.
- As an enhancement, building a Graphical User Interface (GUI), instead of Command Line Interface (CLI) for increasing the user-base and monetising the product.
- Providing Advanced Options to filter, modify and modulate the voice acording to the user requirements and convenience.

# Overall Experience

- When I was looking for projects of Winter of Code'20, dynopii - PyVirtualAudioCable was one of the projects that intrigued me the most, because of some primary reasons:
  - The codebase was Python.
  - The project dealt with a real world problem and had to built from scratch.
  - This opens up a lot of doors of opportunity, exploring and learning.
- Quoting Anubhav Singh's words: *"We were given a blank canvas, and we had to paint and open the doors of our imaginations."*
- My overall contribution was not very satisfactory or significant (*I'm sorry for my loss*), but I learned how things worked and interacted in the real world - both codewise and human nature wise.
- However, I was pleased to have mentors like [Aniket Kumar](https://github.com/ani4aniket), along with [Abhishek Nandy](https://github.com/abhilegend), [Kazi Haque](https://github.com/kazi92), and [Snehangshu Bhattacharya](https://github.com/forkbomb-666) & also, a "code-mate" like [Arush](https://github.com/arushsharma24), all of them were very respectful, friendly and genuine.
- Finally, I was very glad to have a mentor like - [xprilion](https://github.com/xprilion/) whose words are very insightful and full of valid reasoning. My only regret would be that, I didn't converse, interact and brainstorm more with him, because his experience truly speaks. I will definitely look up to him in the future.
