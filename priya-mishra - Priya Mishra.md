### DSC NIT Rourkela: Project – Avocado 

 Overview
# Contributions

The project was an upgrade to better documentation of the home page in MVVM (model-view,view-model) architecture. The home page of the app is where all the features of the app are accessed from by hundreds of students everyday. My work over this winter made the documentation of the code better and the improved state management made the code more readable and easy to maintain for any future changes.

I am Priya Mishra, an undergraduate student from Mumbai University, as part of Winter of Code.

This project was mentored by – Abel Matthew, Chinmay kabi, and Smarak Das and the project had constant guidance from all three of them.

# Future Scope

Though my time spent on the project is short, I believe my work has made a significant impact in the maintainability of the code put In by many contributors like myself. Suffice to say that the work has only begun and the conversion of all other pages of the app to MVVM architecture will take place subsequently.

# Overall Experience

I had an exciting and informative winter this year working on project-avocado as a part of Winter of Code. I am grateful to have been mentored by Abel, Chinmay and Smarak who have played a big role in my growth as a developer this past month. Working on this project opened my mind to many new experiences in the open-source community. I would like express my heartfelt gratitude towards my peers and my mentors who made my experience of Winter of Code an unforgettable one.
