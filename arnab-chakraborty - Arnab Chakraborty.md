### DSC-NSEC : DSC-NSEC Algorithms

**Overview:-**
*DSC-NSEC Algorithms project consisted of several Competitive Programming problems from varying topics ranging from Arrays,Strings and Linked List to*
*DP,Binary tree,Graph and Backtracking*
*The problems were of varying difficulties from easy to medium and then the harder ones making the entire project extremely*
*beneficial and Student friendly to all those who are starting with their journey for Competitive Programming*

# New Features   
**No such feature added**

*As because this was not a project where there were issues for bug fixes or adding new features.It was just a project for contributing various codes*
*in different languages like JAVA,C++ to the problems present in the repository*

# Code Contributions
*Here is the Link to some of my PR's:-*
  - [Push Zero PR](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/pull/120#event-4133556314)

*And many more PR's*

# Future Scope
*Currently the repo contains only a few Selected but quality problems but if we continue adding such quality problems and then later*
*also add resources for learning and solving such problems,along with Several Coding Competitions details and their registration times,then this repository can be made a good learning*
*platform for Competitive Coding for the students and can be used by students to strengthen their hold on DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms)*

# Overall Experience
*The Overall Experience of mine with this DSC-NSEC project was fabulous.Along with learning various different Complicated Data Structures like*
*Binary Tree and Graph,I also learnt several other things like how to write the code with a proper lint,how to approach the mentors for help,how to improvise the code*
*with better time and space complexity,and of course,got a good hold over the version control.I also want to thank all the mentors associated with this project for their outstanding support*
*,who were always available there to help me out wherever I faced trouble.In spite of making errors,they helped me out in correcting it by myself only which helped me a lot*
*to understand my errors.*

**So to rate my Overall experience with this project was simply outstanding and I hope this experience of mine will help me a lot in my future projects as well.**
