### eduAlgo : eduAlgo App

eduAlgo is a very simple python package made with python scripts to study different algorithms for educational purposes. This package has been officially published at PyPi. The project can be viewed here => PyPi - eduAlgo.
The objective of this project is to develop an application for android OS, using which one can access to the documentation, codes and methods of the eduAlgo package.
My work over the winter of code made this app very user friendly with various additional features

I am Samyak Singh, an undergraduate student from JSSATE, Noida, as part of NSEC Winter of Code.

This project was mentored by - Abhijit Tripathy

# 1. Implemented Splash Screen in App without use of any External Package
In this task, I have implemented a splash screen for the eduAlgo app demo without use of any 3rd party library or external package in pure Dart Code. Earlier eduAlgo is using splash_screen package which is quite inefficent. 

* [#25](https://github.com/Abhijit2505/edualgo-app-demo/pull/25])  Implemented Splash Screen

In Flutter it is always preferable to use as less packages or external library as possible to reduce the size of the app. Hence by Implementing this feature App size is reduced to around 200kb. 


# 2. Implemented Card for Code Snippet with Syntax Highlighter
I have devloped a customized Card for code snippet.

* [#28](https://github.com/Abhijit2505/edualgo-app-demo/pull/28])  Implemented Card for Code Snippet

Implemented Card for Code Snippet with Syntax Highlighting as a Separate Widget . Code can be passes to this widget as a String .Different Highlighted colors is provided to differnet types of Keywords, charachters, digits etc..


# 3. Devleloped an Interactive Sorting Algorithim Vizualiser
This task is one of the most challenging one as I have to develop an Algorithm Vizualizer on my own .Learning an algorithm gets much easier with visualizing it. In Simple words it is another yet a simple and Interactive way to visualize differnet algorithms.

* [#29](https://github.com/Abhijit2505/edualgo-app-demo/pull/29])  Implemented Visualizer for Bubble and Selection Sort

In this task , I have Implemented an Alogorithm Vizualizer in Dart for common sorting Algorithms including Bubble and Selection Sort. I have also Added a button also to re suffle the numbers after sorting. To make more attractive and Easy to Understand differnet numbers are represented according to their heights Using Flutter Charts

# Future Scope
There is always some place for enhancements in any software application, however good and efficient the application may be.
Even after developing these adavnced features in the app , I feel like there is many things which can be implemented in the Future. Some of them are:

* Implementing state management for the app in Bloc Patteren or Provider.
* Algorithm Vizualizer for Searching Algorithms such as Linear Search and Binary Search
* Dark Mode for the app
* Publishing the app to Play Store


# Overall Experience
Overall I have a great experince working in a cool project which is aligned with my skills and Interest.Being a competitive programmer and working on projects that involves some data structures and Algorithms is my always fun. I am glad that I am able to complete all the tasks that is given by my mentor and finalizing the project tasks within the limited time frame. I was glad to be mentored by Abhijit Tripathy (thanks for going through all my PRs!). Being a part of Winter of Code helped me in doing a lot of Research and i came to know about so many new things , i am also thankful to them for organising such kind of amazing of events. I am glad to be a part of Winter of Code 2020 !
