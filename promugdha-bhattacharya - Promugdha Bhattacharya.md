**Overview**

#CONTRIBUTIONS

1.Conversion From *Class Component* To *Functional Component*

All the components of the webapp Logo Generator were written in class format,initially.Our first task was to convert the Class based component to Function based Component.Each of us took slices and worked on it,i personally converted the file GDGEditor.js .

2.Conversion From *JSX* to *TSX*

My next task was to convert JSX files into TSX files, TSX categorizes all kinds of variables/elements,and also it is widely accepted in the tech world.

In order to perform this task I referred to React TSX documentation.![](Report.003.png)

3.Creating a User *Log in/Sign up* portal and integrating it with *Firebase![](Report.003.png)*

This page/component was created to restrict unknown users from accessing the logo,or allowing them to personalize their own logo.The frontend of the page was created with the help of materialUI,Reactstrap,CSS.The user was Signed up/Logged in with username(email id) and password.Confirmation or Rejection notifications were also induced,with the help of firebase return statements.Also a user profile portal is being created,to display the downloaded/saved logos of the user.The Realtime database of firebase is used to do so.The documentation of firebase explaining the storage of blobs in it,came in handy.

**New Features**

1.Log in/Sign up,User Authentication 2.Preserving user data (under construction) 3.Faster User experience

**Future Scope**

We have already planned and started working on *user profile*,to display the downloaded/saved logos,of the user.The users will be able to share their personalized logos,with a shareable URL link.

**Experience**

Overall it was a learning experience,the mentors were very kind and helpful.I had a wish to work in an open source environment for a long time,and i am satisfied and happy after this event.Finally i would like to thank my fellow team-mates,and cheers to a wonderful collaboration.![](Report.003.png)
