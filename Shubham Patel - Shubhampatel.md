The link shows my Contributions in Tesseract Coding:
My each PR is equal to 2 PRs as i had worked on same issue in different language and for the feasibility of the maintainer i have made a single PR for same issue.
Issues i had worked on :
1.Count Ways to N’th stair(issue #1588):
I had solved this problem in Java and Python.
This program finds the total number of possible combinations that can be used to climb statirs . EG : for 3 stairs ,combination and output will be 1,1,1 , 1,2 , 2,1
 i.e 3.
Things i have learnt solving this problem : Recursion .




Boyer Moore Majority Voting algorithm(issue#1439):
I had created this issue in the repo and solution of this algorithm was provided by me in java and python language.
The Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm is an algorithm for finding the majority of a sequence of elements using linear time and constant space.
Things i have learnt solving this problem : Working with arrays .

My PR’s :
